Taskmaster is a simple to use MERN stack application that allows users to manage their daily tasks. Taskmaster works quite simply. With the "create new task" button, users are able to create custom tasks that will be displayed on screen. With the provided "X" button, users are able to delete tasks when they are complete, making for a simple but manageable digital to do list.
